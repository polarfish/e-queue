e-queue
=======

1. It's actually a hackathon project so it is in early stage of development.
2. No validation for user_names and queue names - they must satisfy url substitutions to use it as is.
3. Now there are no registration - only one hardcoded user donetsk_post/donetsk_post
4. mobile_apps contains applications made with appery.io and compiled for android platform - you can install it and test REST functionality (they are tuned to work with http://queue-polarfish.rhcloud.com/ which has version 0.1.0 deployed).
